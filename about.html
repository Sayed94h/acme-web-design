        <h3>What should a good About Us page contain?</h3>
        <p>
          I need to start this article by qualifying what makes an amazing About Us page. 
          The reason for this is that some About Us pages look amazing but have terrible content whilst others look terrible but grab your attention immediately. 
          The list I have compiled here are based on the fact that they:
        </p>
        <section class="info">
          <h4>1. Get the point across</h4>
                <p>First and foremost an About Us page has to get a point across. 
                Everything else is completely useless unless the content and the layout is achieving a goal. 
                That goal is to tell the user who you are by showing them what you can do for them or have done for others.
                </p>
          <h4>2. Quickly direct you to useful content or people</h4>
              <p>Some About Us pages spend the whole time talking about what it is that the company does and nothing about the staff members. 
              Some do the opposite. Good pages should know why you are on the page and what you’re trying to find quickly.
              </p>
          <h4>3. Give you authenticity statements</h4>
               <p>A good About Us page always needs to have some mention of past successes, achievements, social proof, etc. 
               Giving concrete examples of why your site or blog is worth reading is extremely important for these pages.
              </p>
          <h4>4. Contain an email sign up form</h4>
              <p>
               Since writing this post I have included an email sign up form on my About page and have seen a hugely successful subscriber rate. 
               It seems that people want to subscribe to you while they are reading about you!
               I didn’t want to go in to too much detail here because I am going to talk about the advantages of each About Us page as we go through them. 
               I’m hoping to use this post as a way of showing you what I believe you should be doing on your own page.
